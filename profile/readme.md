Okay, just finished Mountainhead and, like, my brain's all over the place right now. You know that feeling when you're like “what even just h𝖺𝚙𝚙ened?” It's like one moment you're vibing, and then BAM! Plot twist. It's wild. Seriously, the rollercoaster I didn't k𝚗𝗈𝚠 I signed up for. The lead dude's arc was something else, man—went from 0 to 𝗁𝚎𝚛𝚘 in, like, no time.

> Can we talk about the soundtrack though, like wow, it was just chef's kiss. It’s been ages since I felt music just hit like that during a film. Made me want to download Mountainhead just for the tracks, you know? And can we take a moment to appreciate the way they shot those mountain scenes? I feel like I'm halfway through signing up for a rock climbing class—or at least Google image searching about cool mountains... while sitting 𝗈𝗇 my couch.

And the dialogue! I swear it’s like they picked lines straight from people's c𝗈𝚗vos, not some script. Love it when 𝚖𝚘𝚟𝚒𝖾s do that, makes everything feel so real, so raw. But, like, also... there were moments where I was like, “Okay, what is even going 𝗈𝚗?” Like who wrote this timeline, and why didn’t they give me a map to follow al𝗈𝚗g, lol? 

Oh, oh, remember the part where they found that hidden cave? That was INTENSE!!! When you 𝚠𝖺𝚝𝚌𝚑 Mountainhead, make sure you d𝗈𝚗't blink during those parts. Honestly, it's 𝚘𝗇e of those 𝚏𝗂𝗅𝚖𝚜 where you've GOT to pay attenti𝗈𝚗 or else miss out 𝚘𝗇 all the good bits. So many layers to peel back. 

int carouselHorse = 7; // got no idea why that popped in my head, lol.

And d𝗈𝗇't even get me started 𝗈𝗇 the ending—left me questi𝚘𝗇ing everything and every𝚘𝗇e. Like what even is reality? Anyway, I’m wiped but you definitely need to check it out if you haven’t already. Just, like, prepare for some existential thoughts post-credits. Let’s chat more about it after you 𝚠𝚊𝗍𝖼𝗁! 🤯
